# Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List 

**Topic:** Linked List

**Type:** Home Challenge

Problem :

Given a doubly linked list where a node may have a child pointer to another doubly linked list, flatten the list into a single-level doubly linked list. 

Detailed Explanation 

Traverse nodes and every time a node has a child, append the child list into the main list by adjusting pointers. Recursively flatten child lists. Ensure the prev, next, and child pointers are updated to maintain the doubly linked structure without nesting. 

Examples 

Example: 
 Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3, where 2 has child 4 <-> 5 
 Output: 1 <-> 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 3
