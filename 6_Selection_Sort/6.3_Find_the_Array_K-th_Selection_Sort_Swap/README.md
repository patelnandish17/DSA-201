# Find the Array K-th Selection Sort Swap
**Topic:** Selection Sort

Problem: Track Selection Sort Process 

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. 

 Simulate the Selection Sort process, and return the array after the k-th swap is performed. 

If the algorithm performs fewer than k swaps in total, return the fully sorted array. 

 

Example 1 

Input: nums = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11], k = 2 
Output: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64] 
 
Explanation: 
- Swap 1: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64] 
- Swap 2: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64] 
Since k = 2, return after second swap. 
  

Example 2 

Input: nums = [5, 3, 4, 1, 2], k = 10 
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
 
Explanation: 
- Selection sort completes in only 4 swaps. 
- Since k > 4, return final sorted array. 
  


Constraints 

1 <= nums.length <= 5000 

-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5 

1 <= k <= 10^6 

 

Follow-up 

Can you optimize the simulation to stop early when no swaps are needed? 

How would this problem change if we asked for the array after k iterations instead of k swaps?
