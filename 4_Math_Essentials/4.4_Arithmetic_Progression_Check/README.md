Problem 4: Arithmetic Progression Check 

Difficulty: Easy 
Topics: Array, Sorting 

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. 

Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false. 

Example 1: 

Input: arr = [3,5,1] 
Output: true 
Explanation: We can reorder as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively. 
 

Example 2: 

Input: arr = [1,2,4] 
Output: false 
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression. 
 

Constraints: 

2 <= arr.length <= 1000 

-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
